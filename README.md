## 🚀 Getting Started

Because ProPlanner is a single-file application, getting started is incredibly simple:

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proplanner-ultimate.git
Open the file: Double-click task.html (or index.html if you rename it) to open it in your favorite modern web browser.
Start Planning!
Note: An active internet connection is briefly required on the first load to fetch the Tailwind CSS CDN.
🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure.
Tailwind CSS (via CDN): Rapid, utility-first styling with custom configurations for themes and animations.
Vanilla JavaScript: State management, local storage interaction, DOM manipulation, and routing all handled without a framework.
📂 Project Structure
The entire application lives in one file, cleanly organized into:
<head>: Metadata, Tailwind Configuration, Custom CSS variables, and Keyframe animations.
<body>:
Semantic UI layout (Sidebar, Mobile Nav, Main Content Area).
Hidden Modals (Task Creation, Settings, Focus Mode Overlay).
<script>: The app object containing state, router, views, data management, and UI logic.
💡 Usage Tips
Desktop Search: Press Ctrl + K (or Cmd + K on Mac) anywhere in the app to immediately focus the search bar.
Backups: Since data is saved in your browser's Local Storage, remember to periodically go to Settings > Export Backup to save a .json copy of your tasks to your local hard drive.
Mobile Experience: Add the page to your Home Screen on iOS or Android for a native app-like experience without the browser address bar.
